# MIDI monitor

Use a Web MIDI enabled browser to monitor incoming MIDI signals through MIDI, USB or bluetooth and route them in any configuration.

Once connected, MIDI inputs show at the top row of the screen. You can select them and a list of available outputs will show. Click on an output to create an active MIDI link. All input signals will be sent immediately to the corresponding outputs. You can assign one input as a main clock source and it'll send clock signal to all connected outputs too.

No more need to run DAW to route MIDI! Just open a browser tab and have fun! The app will show all incoming notes and CC changes in a clean table. You can click or tap on a note or move a slider on the screen to send a MIDI message to all active outputs.

Click on [MIDI] button to play/stop midi sequencers, clear the monitor and select active global outputs. The app can be used both on desktop and mobile devices. Plug your devices into a powered USB-hub and connect it to your Android device with an OTG cable adapter or to an iPhone or an iPad with the lightning/usb adapter.


The Web MIDI technology has been already implemented in Chrome and Opera on desktop and Android phones and tablets. For iOS devices there is a dedicated free [Web MIDI Browser](https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/web-midi-browser/id953846217). Get more compatibility info at [Caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/#search=web%20midi). Internally the app uses [WebMidi.js](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi) for handling messages.
